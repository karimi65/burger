## Description
Creating a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.

  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
   

## Installation:
After download the project, run `npm install` in terminal. Do not forget to run it at the same directory which your downloaded folder is. Also, put your own username and password at `connection.js` file. Then, write `node server.js` to run!
